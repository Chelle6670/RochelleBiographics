            <p><em>"In Senior HighSchool I was very inspired with my cousin because I saw her how she program and then I tell them that i want to take the course which the same with her. Honestly, I dont know how to code that time. I dont know why I want to take Information technology even I dont know anything. My first choice is nursing but then my feet wants to go IT department and my mind wants to say anything and then I realized I know why I pursue this course because he wants me to learn and prove that this is not a choice but it is interesting  in every different way which I believe in saying that error is a part of the process and they teach me on how to find solutions in every errors and learn something new"</em></p>
